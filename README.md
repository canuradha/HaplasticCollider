### About
This is a Educational tool that can be used to enhance the Learning Experiance of mainly two basic concepts in Physics, Collisions (Elastic and Inelastic) and Gravitational Forces.
The system provides a simulated progressive self-learning platform that is to be used with the Haply for understanding the mentioned concepts. The tool contains 5 main modules in addition to the begginning and ending views. The 5 main modules can be described as: 
- Elastic Collision Module
- Inelastic Collision Module
- Questionnaire Module 1 (Including both Elastic and Inelastic Collsion simulations)
- Gravitation Module
- Questionnaire Module 2 (Including Gravitational Forces Simualtion)
- Mini-Game Sandbox (A mini-game where the user needs to reach a goal successfully in an evironment where all the previously learned concepts are present)

The Following video describes the functionality of the modules:
